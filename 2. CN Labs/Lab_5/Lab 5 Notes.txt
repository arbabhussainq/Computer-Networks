->Switches:
	Switch CLI
	->Connect one PC with console - RS 32
	->One with straight through ethernet
Cisco Networking Devices use iOS (Inter Operating Networking System)
	switch > => User EXE Mode

	->go to switch CLI
Commands:
	1. show ? -> Shows all available commands (user exe mode)
	2. enable or en -> It will enable privilege exe mode denoted by switch#
		Limited commands can run in privilege exe mode
	3. config t or configure terminal -> will enable global configuration mode
		will show switch(config)

	4. exit -> to go from global configuration mode to privileges mode
	5. disable -> from privileges mode to user exe mode




	For remote accessing the switch: We use telnet
	or we can directly configure switch by using iOS global configuration mode via ethernet cable.


	Steps:
		->Assign ip address to pcs
		->Assign hostname to switch
					->hostname 22sw028
		->Assign Password to switch
					->enable secret password:
			Now whenever someone wants to use our switch, he will have to give the password.
		->Assigning Password to Telnet.
					->Line vty 0 15 -> Means 1 to 15 connections can remotely access it.
					->password yourpassword
					->login


		->After that, come back to user privileges mode, then type
		show running-config:
					It will show all configurations
		Password of CLI would be encrypted, but password of telnet won't be encrypted.
		->To encrypt the telnet password, use command
					->service password-encryption:
								This command will encrypt the password of telnet too.
								This will encrypt all further passwords too.

		->Configuring Switch:
					->interface vlan 1 (will change to (config-if)
		->To assign IP address:
					->ip address address subnet mask
					->ip address 192.168.0.20 255.255.255.0
		->no shutdown: will make sure that the switch is up
	->Configuring Default Gateway of Switch:
					switch(config-if)#exit
					switch(config)#ip default-gateway 192.168.0.254
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

	Now to access the switch from command line of any computer:
	->type telnet ipaddressofswitch
	telnet 192.168.0.20:  It will give access to the switch remotely
	->enable
	->config t
